Early Detection of Mortality Risks in Preterm Neonates Using Random Forest Classifier and TPOT AutoML: A Machine Learning Approach and Statistics Analysis  
Early detecting and exact predicting the chances of newborn babies (premature) and infants surviving is crucial for evaluating the quality of healthcare in hospitals.
This research presents a powerful tool as a golden combination of AI and Statistics to get the great results (inferential conclusions).
Artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are popular in healthcare and engineering, can help doctors and hospital Personnel better predict if a premature baby will survive.
This research article aims to use machine learning to predict the risk of mortality in premature infants, with the goal of helping them survive by Random Forest Classifier learning model.
The article also identifies important factors that directly affect a baby's chances of survival. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of about 98% without overfitting issue in predicting a baby's status after birth.
In this survival analysis, minimizing false negatives (FN) in the confusion matrix holds particular significance. So, one of main aims of this project is minimizing both FN and FP particularly FN (by using some special techniques).
As a result, we found great compatibility and agreement among the proposed method results in this research work.
When doctors recognize that a baby is at risk, they can provide special care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to improve their chances of survival.
The study explored different models to find the most accurate one. In summary, this research used machine learning with Python programming to predict the survival of premature babies after birth in the hospital. 

This study, in addition to statistics analysis, aims to predict immediate post-delivery outcomes (alive or dead) of infants in hospitals, using AI/ML models.
Due to the lack of a comprehensive dataset, providing accurate information about preterm infant outcomes is challenging.
The study seeks to enhance neonatal mortality early prediction, identify key features, and assess risk factors in the given population, with potential applicability to other countries.
This effort can guide healthcare professionals in better caring for both mothers and infants.
Also, in addition to optimizing (minimizing) FP and FN, the accuracy of the model has increased considerably to 98% in this Random Forest Classifier model compared to previous research works like [18] with 91%. Note that, the entire process including preprocessing the dataset and extracting the important features have been improved to get a high accuracy. 
This suitable package has been shown in the text by an algorithm graphically (see Fig. 1). 
Note that AutoML (TPOT) has been solely employed to extract the best pipeline and optimal parameters. All preprocessing steps have been done separately.
